The register Case  I Have two cases 
/*
"fullName": "youssef Elkondakly",
  "username":"youssef2011",
*/
BAsically I will make an extra endpoint
## First
I if the length of the result is greater than 1 I will make a response to confirm the phone Number **AS ITS UNIQUE** 

## Second
I will make an extra unique column that have username and  
I if the length of the result is greater than 1 == I will make him confirm his user name 

## Third
I will make one Column for birthDate and Edit the name column to be full name 
so whn the dublication happened we will ask him to add the second two entities of his name 
and to input his birthDate then confirm at this stage if there is a dublicate we will show the usernames only 
so when he choses one he finally success logged in
